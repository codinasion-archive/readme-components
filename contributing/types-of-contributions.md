### :mega: Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion/discussions).

### :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://github.com/codinasion/README/issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/codinasion/README/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request](https://github.com/codinasion/README/pulls) is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa:
